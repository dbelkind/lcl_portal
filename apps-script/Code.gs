// Connects the Lifespan Cognition Lab Researcher Portal to Google Calendar and email. It keeps three calendars for lab managers:
// - "LCL Visits": each participant visit, colored by its booking (gray open, blue booked, orange waiting to be
//   rebooked), with who's available for each part. Updated every 10 minutes, and straight away when the site pings it.
// - "LCL Confirmed Visits": each staffed visit, with who's doing what. Updated every 10 minutes.
// - "LCL Birthdays & Graduations": everyone's birthday and expected graduation, for the next year. Updated every hour.
// It also emails reviewers about requests, cancellations, and at 8:30 AM which visit's scan to book and upcoming
// birthdays and graduations, and emails staff about the visits they're staffing.
// Run setUp() once from the Apps Script editor, and again whenever this file changes.
//
// The staffing rules aren't copied here. They're loaded from the published site's scheduling.js on every run,
// so the calendars always match what the website shows.
//
// Calendar access uses Google's "calendars created by this app" permission, so the script can only see and change
// the calendars it makes, never your other calendars. That permission can't share them, so share them by hand.
